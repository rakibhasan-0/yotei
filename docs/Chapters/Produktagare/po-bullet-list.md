# Bullet-list
Bold marks the latest added points.

1. Continous integration by splitting tickets to the point where the affected files are 1 or two files and a merge request is possible after a days work.

2. Meetings will be documented, summarized into a bullet-list in Git and a message is posted in discord announcing a updated bullet-list.

3. Be mindful of writing in discord to limit cluttering. The best conversations are had in person and decisions are always documented in Git.

4. We are one team, no matter the group division and we are all working towards the same goal.

5. **Once the soft-limit has started regarding merging on Git, we prioritize certain commits over others, this means that the merge requests will be paused at times in order to allow high-priority tickets to be merged.**

[5] Prioritized tickets are determined by promises made to the customer. Pausing merge requests will mean that non-prioritized merges will be placed following the prioritized ones, which will lead to them having to rebase.<br />
