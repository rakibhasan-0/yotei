# Bullet-list
Bold marks the latest added points.

1. We have decided to add a third user because one group did not have enough to do and it is something that the customer wanted.

2. Its important to start using css-modules. Examples can be found in the readme in frontend.

3. **Continuously look through imp, try to find errors (buggar) in both functionality and design. Create a ticket and place it on the Sprint backlog trello board in either "S3 designmissar" or "S3 Refaktorisering/Buggfix".**

4. **Always check with other groups if you know that they are working on a similar thing or problem before starting a ticket.**

5. **We will start working on transforming the API endpoints to become more restful**
