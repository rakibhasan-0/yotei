# How to deliver to the customer
Run the script *deliver.sh*. 
The script uses ssh to pull the git repos, you might be prompted to use your password 4 times for the repos if you don't have a key on gitlab.
The script creates the following files:
- budo.zip
- deploy.sh
- deploy.md

These files should be sent to the customer at delivery.
