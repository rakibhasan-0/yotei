# Test guide for frontend 
From now on, tests should be written for new functionality produced in the frontend of the project.
We expect people from now on to start building tests and develop TDD-ish. 

## Testing frameorks to be used
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

# Jest
Jest is a framework for testing Javascript code that will be used together with the React Testing Library.

**Install Jest with:**

    npm install --save-dev jest 

## TODO: Jest code exampels of tests here

# React Testing Library
React Testing Library includes functionality to test React components. It is used together with Jest to make a testing framework for our frontend.

**Install React Testing Library with:**

    npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react 

**Tests should be placed in a folder called**

    __tests__ 

** Tests should use the naming conventing **

    filename.test.jsx
    
For example the file **plan.jsx** should have the corresponding testfile **plan.test.jsx** placed in the test folder.
