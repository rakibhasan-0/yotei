# Test guide for frontend 
From now on, tests should be written for new functionality produced in the frontend of the project.
We expect people from now on to start building tests and develop TDD-ish. 

## Testing frameorks to be used
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

# Getting started
React Testing Library includes functionality to test React components. It is used together with Jest to make a testing framework for our frontend.

**Install React Testing Library with:**

    npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react 

**Install Jest with:**

    npm install --save-dev jest 

**Tests should be placed in a folder called:**

    __tests__ 

**Tests should use the naming convention**

    filename.test.jsx
