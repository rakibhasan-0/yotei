# Bullet-list
Bold marks the latest added points.

1. **Continous integration by splitting tickets to the point where the affected files are 1 or two files and a merge request is possible after a days work.**

2. **Meetings will be documented, summarized into a bullet-list in Git and a message is posted in discord announcing a updated bullet-list.**

3. **Be mindful of writing in discord to limit cluttering. The best conversations are had in person and decisions are always documented in Git.**

4. **We are one team, no matter the group division and we are all working towards the same goal.**
