# Bullet-list
- Continous integration by splitting tickets to the point where the affected files are 1 or two files and a merge request is possible after a days work.
- Meetings will be documented, summarized into a bullet-list in Git and a message is posted in discord announcing a updated bullet-list.
- Be mindful of writing in discord to limit cluttering. The best conversations are had in person and decisions are always documented in Git.
- We are one team, no matter the group division and we are all working towards the same goal.
